# 🐚 pu – Natural Language CLI Assistant

`pu` lets you run shell commands using natural language.  
Instead of remembering complex syntax, just describe what you want and let `pu` generate the command, show it, and (optionally) run it.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone or download the script:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ariadev/pu.git
   cd pu
   ```

2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x pu.py
   ```

3. Move to your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pu.py /usr/local/bin/pu
   ```

Now you can run `pu` anywhere in your terminal.

---

## ⚙️ Dependencies

* Python **3.9+**
* [OpenAI Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)

Install with:

```bash
pip install openai
```

---

## 🔑 Configuration

On first run, `pu` will create a config file at:

```
~/.puconfig
```

Example boilerplate:

```ini
[openai]
api_key = sk-your-api-key-here
model = gpt-4o-mini
```

You can edit this file to change the default model or API key.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic prompt

```bash
pu -p "list all files in this directory"
```

Example output:

```
📝 Command generated:
ls -lh

Run this command? [y/N]
```

---

### Dry-run (don’t execute)

```bash
pu -p "delete all .tmp files" --dry-run
```

Output:

```
📝 Command generated:
rm *.tmp

💡 Dry run mode: command not executed.
```

---

### With file context

```bash
pu -p "unzip all files except ones starting with _" --with-files 1
```

This sends your prompt + the file tree (depth = 1) to OpenAI so it can generate more context-aware commands.

---

### History

Every run (prompt, command, executed or not) is logged in:

```
~/.pu_history
```

Example:

```
[2025-09-29T13:45:10]
Prompt: delete all .tmp files
Command: rm *.tmp
Executed: False
```

---

## 💡 Use Cases

* `pu -p "rename all .jpg files to .png"`
* `pu -p "start a python http server on port 8080"`
* `pu -p "create a tar.gz archive of all txt files"`
* `pu -p "git reset hard to origin/main"`
* `pu -p "docker remove all stopped containers"`

---

⚠️ **Warning:** Commands are generated by AI. Always check them before execution!
Use `--dry-run` if unsure.
